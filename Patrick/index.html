<H2 id="overskrift"> Why Patrick Bateman is literally me?</H2>
    
<p id="storTekst"> 

    The main character of Bret Easton Ellis' novel, adapted into Mary Hannon's 2000 horror comedy film "American Psycho" has astonishing resemblance to myself. 
    His psyche, morning routine, skin care feel like inspired by that of my own. His deep conversational topics and complex thought processes resemble uncanny similarity to mine.
     I believe the character was partly, if not fully, inspired by my personal life story. With every rewatch I convince myself that my superego is mirrored in Patrick's id. 
     His corporate neoliberal lifestyle is the essence of my existence. His immaculate fashion sense is only matcged by that of mine. 
     I sometimes stumble upon memes with Patrick, and I need to regulate my computer to check if someone used my own photo without permission. 
     Dare I even say, every now and then I find myself incontrollably mimicking Bateman's facial expressions while listening to Huey Lewis and The News and booking a 8:30 pm reservation in Dorsia.
      No character ever will come this close to myself as him.
